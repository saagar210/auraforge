# Installing AuraForge

## What You Need

- A Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- About 20 GB of free disk space (for the AI model)
- An internet connection (for the initial model download only)

## Step 1: Install Ollama

Ollama is a free app that runs AI models locally on your Mac. AuraForge uses it so your data never leaves your machine.

1. Go to [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Download the Mac version
3. Open the downloaded file and drag Ollama to your Applications folder
4. Open Ollama from Applications — you'll see a small llama icon appear in your menu bar

That's it. Ollama runs quietly in the background.

## Step 2: Install AuraForge

1. Double-click **AuraForge_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg**
2. Drag AuraForge to your Applications folder
3. Open AuraForge from Applications

> **First launch note:** macOS may warn that AuraForge is from an unidentified developer. If this happens:
> - Click **Cancel** on the warning
> - Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
> - Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the AuraForge message
> - Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

## Step 3: Follow the Setup Wizard

When AuraForge opens for the first time, a setup wizard walks you through everything:

1. **Welcome** — Click "Get Started"
2. **Ollama Check** — AuraForge detects Ollama automatically. If it's running, you'll see a green checkmark.
3. **Download AI Model** — Click "Download Model" and wait for the download to finish (~18 GB, one-time only). You can see progress as it downloads.
4. **Ready** — Click "Start Planning" to begin your first session.

## Using AuraForge

1. **Describe your project** — Type what you want to build in plain language
2. **Answer questions** — AuraForge will ask clarifying questions to understand your project
3. **Forge the plan** — When the plan is solid, click "Forge the Plan" to generate your documents
4. **Save to a folder** — Export the generated documents to use with your coding tools

## Troubleshooting

**AuraForge says it can't find Ollama**
- Make sure Ollama is running (look for the llama icon in your menu bar)
- If you don't see it, open Ollama from Applications

**Model download is slow or fails**
- Large model downloads can take a while on slower connections
- If it fails, click "Download Model" again — it resumes from where it left off

**App won't open on macOS**
- See the "First launch note" above about macOS security settings

**Need more help?**
- Open the help panel inside AuraForge (click the **?** button or press **Cmd+?**)
